# The Consumer Producer Problem

The Chef (Producer) prepares plates of food and places them on the Container (that has a limit how many plates can be placed). The Consumer takes the plate from the Container. The Container is a shared resource for the Producer and the Consumer.

This exercise is a part of **MindSwap** bootcamp practice.
